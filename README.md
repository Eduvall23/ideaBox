# ideaBox
## Abstract
We built an interface to create, store, and organize new ideas!</br> 
### Features
- User can create new cards for each idea.
- Stored cards will be displayed in a dynamic grid that the user can scroll through.
- Each card has a delete button and a favorite button.
- Favorited cards can be displayed using the "Show Starred Ideas" button.
- User can toggle back to all ideas with the same button (now, with updated inner text).

## Context
- Completing 4 iterations and bug fixes took about 12 hours of work time including research
- All contributors are 4 weeks into learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in the Turing Front End Engineering program
  
## Learning Goals
- Gain understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Practice separation of the data model from the DOM model
- Incorporate & iterate over arrays to filter displays
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness, SRP, and purity
  
## Wins and Challenges
- Challenge 1: Maintaining simple functions to complete processes for complex features
- Challenge 2: Finding and fixing bugs methodically
- Win 1: Shifting the card display with arrows to handle displaying 4+ cards
- Win 2: Successful collaboration across 3 timezones
